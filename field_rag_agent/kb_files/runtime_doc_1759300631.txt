Methodology
The system employs a meticulous two-stage approach:

Stage 1: Image Classification with CNN

Data Preprocessing:
Image Processing: Advanced techniques like adaptive histogram equalization and noise reduction ensure optimal image quality.
Data Augmentation: Utilizes sophisticated strategies like random cropping and elastic transformations to enrich the training data and enhance model robustness.
Padding: Strategically employs zero-padding to normalize image dimensions and mitigate edge noise.

Model Architecture:

The CNN architecture, meticulously crafted by our data science team, leverages:
3 Convolutional Layers with Batch Normalization: Extract complex spatial features from the image while controlling internal covariate shift for improved stability.
3 Max-Pooling Layers: Downsample feature maps effectively, reducing computational cost and promoting generalization.
3 Dropout Layers: Employ a strategic dropout rate, determined through rigorous hyperparameter tuning, to prevent overfitting during training.
Activation Function (ReLU): Introduces non-linearity for improved learning capabilities.
Flatten Layer: Efficiently converts feature maps into a one-dimensional vector for feeding into fully connected layers.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer, renowned for its efficiency and convergence speed, is employed for gradient descent during training.
Loss Function: Categorical cross-entropy loss function, ideal for multi-class classification problems, ensures optimal model training.
Output Activation Function (Softmax): Generates a probability distribution over the document classes, enabling confident classification.
